# MPPCA
Quick and dirty Python3 implementation of Mixtures of Probabilistic Principal Component Analysers

## Description

Mixtures of Probabilistic Principal Component Analysers (MPPCA) is a simple yet powerful algorithm used to cluster data into linear subspaces. Its applications cover clustering, density estimation and classification.

## How to use it ?

See the ipython notebook `mppca_demo.ipynb`.


## About this implementation

This implementation is a translation of the matlab implementation Mathieu Andreux and I made in Matlab.

In high dimensions, a logarithmic representation of numbers was required to avoid underflows. Other tricks are well described in the original paper.
